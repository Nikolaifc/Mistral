Hello,

I used Cypress to automate the web application
I am sending you a short instruction for setting up the test environment and running the tests.
When opening a folder in one of the code editors, it is necessary to perform an -npm install- in terminal to install all the packages
After that we use commmand - npx cypress open - to open Cypress GUI to run the tests

There are two groups of tests:
- Registration tests
- Tests for purchase

Clicking on any of the tests automatically starts the script

Test plan for UI testing:
The plan contains several test cases as an example of how the whole plan would look like

This is a test plan for API Testing:
